# Branches

- [bootstrap-4](https://github.com/kkoomen/react-boilerplate/tree/bootstrap-4)

    A duplicate of the master branch, including bootstrap 4.

# Getting started

- Clone the repository
- (optional, but recommended) Go into `package.json` and set the `name` property
  at the top to your new project its name. This will also set local storage keys
  automatically correct.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

# Absolute imports

Example:<br />
- JSX: `import Button from 'src/components/Button';`
- SCSS: `background-image: url('~src/assets/images/icons/icongrid.svg');`

# Linting

All rules within linting are set to a warning, except for those that are
definitely a no-op, such as deprecated functions, or really bad ways of handling
code such as the use of `eval()`. Linters should suggest, not force.

If you find any rules that are left out or should be different, feel free to
make a pull request.

# Useful tools

Optional extensions that might be useful.

## Chrome extensions
